Prime Academy Resume

I modeled the (basic) design of the resume off of a resume template, but all of the code that went into recreating it and making it interactive was mine. 
I tested the final page on 3 browsers as well as 1 on mobile to make sure it looked and acted the way I intended, but there may be some blindspots I missed.
This was a fun project and I look forward to learning more. :)
